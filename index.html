        <h1 align="center">Introduction</h1>
        <h3 align="center">Professional Background</h3>
        <p>As a <span style="color:rgb(228, 33, 33)">Cyber Security major</span> at Jacksonville University, 
            I have developed a strong foundation in cyber security. 
            Through both coursework and hands-on projects, 
            I have gained experience in identifying vulnerabilities, managing risks, 
            and implementing solutions to protect critical systems. 
            My minor in Naval Science complements my technical education, 
            providing me with insight into naval strategy, leadership, and operations. 
            This combination of disciplines has allowed me to prepare for both technical 
            and leadership roles within the cybersecurity field, particularly in military settings.</p>
        <h3 align="center">Skills</h3>
        <p>I possess a diverse skill set that includes knowledge of cybersecurity protocols, 
            vulnerability assessment, and incident response. 
            <br>I am proficient in using tools like Wireshark, which allow me to detect 
            and mitigate security threats effectively. My studies in Naval Science have also equipped me 
            with leadership, critical thinking, and decision-making skills under pressure. </p>
        <h3 align="center">Goals</h3>
        <p>My ultimate goal is to serve as a commissioned officer in the U.S. Navy, 
            specializing in cyber warfare or information security. 
            I am committed to leveraging my cybersecurity expertise and leadership abilities 
            to protect national defense systems against digital threats. 
            I am eager to take on the challenges that come with safeguarding national interests, 
            both on land and at sea, and I am dedicated to continuous personal and professional 
            growth as I pursue this career path</p>
